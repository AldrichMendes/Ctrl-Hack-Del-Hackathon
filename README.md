# CarePoints
## Inspiration
The inspiration for CarePoints came from the growing need for accessible home care services and the desire to create a platform that empowers volunteers to give back to their communities. We wanted to build a system that not only connects clients with volunteers but also rewards volunteers for their dedication, making caregiving a more engaging and fulfilling experience. 

## What it does
CarePoints is a platform where clients can create job postings for various home care services, including Housekeeping, Health Monitoring, and Nutritional Support. Volunteers can browse these postings through a personalized dashboard, filtered by categories such as distance, type of care, and availability. As volunteers complete jobs, they earn points and receive ratings based on their performance, fostering a sense of community and recognition.

## How we built it
We built CarePoints using Material UI and Next.js for the front-end. For the back-end, we utilized Node.js and JavaScript to handle server-side logic, manage databases, and interact with files. The platform integrates several features such as user authentication, job filtering, and location-based services to ensure that volunteers can easily find jobs suited to them. We also implemented a points system to track volunteer contributions and provide feedback through ratings.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was connecting our front-end with the back-end. It involved a lot of trial and error, especially when handling API calls, managing state between components, and ensuring data consistency across the platform. We also encountered difficulties in implementing real-time updates for job postings and ensuring that our login system was both secure and user-friendly. Debugging issues related to file handling in Node.js was another hurdle that required significant effort.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our login system, which ensures secure authentication for both clients and volunteers. Additionally, the personalized dashboard for volunteers is a key achievement—allowing them to see job postings tailored to their preferences based on filters like distance and type of care. 

## What we learned
Throughout this project, we gained valuable insights into how back-end technologies like Node.js work when interacting with files and databases. We also deepened our understanding of front-end development using Next.js and how to efficiently manage state across components. 

## What's next for CarePoints
Moving forward, we plan to enhance CarePoints by adding more advanced features such as real-time notifications for new job postings, a messaging system between clients and volunteers, and integrating geolocation services for more accurate distance-based filtering. We also aim to introduce a reward system where volunteers can redeem points for various benefits or recognition within the community. Expanding the platform’s reach by incorporating mobile app support is another goal on our roadmap.
